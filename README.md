# ResNet loss space analysis

GitHub repository of the related (inplace) paper. WIP

## Getting started

This is a toolbox to reproduce the various experiments conducted in the paper. Mainly, the engine subsection provide several useful function to train/compare/observe different types of networks.

## Code examples

A code for network comparaison can be found [here](ResNetComparison.ipynb).

You can watch CKA application to neural networks [here](CKAComputation.ipynb).
